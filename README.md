## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can start the 



np server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuration
To configure the contact form to work with your own EmailJS account, you need to update the EmailJS service IDs and template IDs. Find the following lines in the codebase and replace them with your own IDs:

```javascript
// src/components/Contact.jsx

const serviceId = 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID';
const templateId = 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID';
const userId = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

You can obtain these IDs by signing up for an account on EmailJS.
